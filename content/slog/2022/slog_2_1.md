## Project Stuff

Right after I posted my last update, the project I mentioned in it imploded. As I said then I wasn't especially
optimistic about it. What caused the implosion was pretty simple. We agreed, essentially, to work on a demo for a game
written for the Godot 3.4 game engine. I wanted to release the source code for this demo under a free license (i.e.,
GNU AGPL-3.0, GNU GPL-3.0, or maybe even a permissive license). Doing so, I feel, would protect my right to use any
work I did on the project for whatever I liked at a later date. Another programmer felt like this would compromise his
ability to profit off of the game software. As a result of our inability to agree to terms we ended up going our
separate ways. I'm a little disappointed but not surprised by the whole thing.

## What's the big deal?

I'm left wondering what the big deal is about licenses like the GPL. I know that the GPL specifically (and moreso my
preferred software license, the dreaded AGPL-3.0) generates a lot of angst. To me it feels like the GPL protects my
interests as a software developer (or at least provides a standard way to protect myself). I get protection from
people using my work (in public) without giving back. Sometimes, I think it's overkill or at least makes the
obligations of all parties confusing. However, for most applications I think it's almost exactly what I'd want.

I suppose, the concern might be that publishing code seems like a magician explaining his tricks. If the source code is
out there then anyone, theoretically, build the software and run it. If the whole value of your work is based on
keeping the process secret there would be a sharp fear of publishing any of it. I wonder how often that's actually the
case though. How often is software valuable simply because you can't take the source and build it yourself?

It seems to me that truly valuable software is valuable irrespective of whether or not I'm deprived of the source code.
Few people are such purists that they compile all of their software from source. I suppose it could be done. I could
compile GRUB, Linux, various user programs (systemd, coreutils, etc.) all from scratch. My computer is probably beefy
enough to do it too. I still don't. Is it really so likely that someone would choose to acquire source for a GPL'd
computer game to avoid payment? Even without the GPL how many Godot games use the kind of high cost, intrusive, DRM
software required to ensure that copies are not distributed?

In the end I think it just amounts to conflicting goals and ways of thinking. I'm not interested in software
development to make a big score (or multiple big scores). I can understand that many people see software as a get
rich quick scheme though. It's hard to ignore that aspect of computer technology broadly. Throughout my life, there
has been, floating, the idea that one good idea could turn a person from a shiftless college student into a
billionaire overnight. I guess it would be nice too but it isn't something I'd hold me breath on.

## Personal Stuff

I've been a bit depressed lately so I've forgone writing anything. I keep trying to write but I haven't been happy
enough with the results to post anything. My plan, is to keep this short and largely personal rather than talk about
any big ideas I have. It's tempting to go in that direction but I don't feel comfortable speaking too authoritatively.

Over the last little while, I've been working on a few things. Primarily, I've been catching up on various household
chores. I've also taken on another game development project. It's proceeding alright although I'm still worried that
it will implode like last time. I'm still working with Godot but C# this time rather than GDScript. I might share some
thoughts about Godot later on but not much has changed with me in that department. I still find it frustrating to work
with. I know it's a lot to ask but I wish I knew anyone with enough faith in me to let me go my own way. It's hard to
expect that right now though.

## Foundation

I also read Isaac Asimov's *Foundation*. I've read about half of the follow-up *Foundation and Empire* too and of
course when I complete that I plan to read *Second Foundation*. I became interested in reading *Foundation* after I saw
[Michael Whelan's](https://www.michaelwhelan.com/)
[illustration of Arkady Darell](https://www.michaelwhelan.com/galleries/arkady/). For whatever reason, I developed a
brief obsession with this image and decided I needed to do my due diligence. I didn't really know much about
*Foundation* going in. I suppose, that it's too old for someone my age to have heard much about it. I read online that
it paralleled the collapse of the Roman Empire but that was really all I knew before reading it.

*Foundation* does, of course, parallel the fall of the Roman Empire. It's pretty explicit. To me, the idea of a
historical national collapse is less interesting than the resulting loss of scientific knowledge (and corresponding
technology). There's not much that I can say about this that Asimov doesn't convey better but I worry that it could
apply as much to individuals (or groups) as to Asimov's Galactic Empire. To keep things grounded, I kind of worry that
I could fall into a similar trap. I feel like a lot of what I'm learning by working with Godot is trivia.
Occasionally, I need to look up a minor linear algebra question but for the most part what I learn about is specific to
Godot. Most problems can be solved (however suboptimally) by judiciously using Godot's vast library of premade parts.
I worry that even if I got really good at arranging software in Godot I would essentially be stagnating. I don't want
to just be an arranger of premade parts.

## Next Time

Since I'm worried about stagnating, I think I'm going to try and balance the game development stuff with the Vulkan
and X11 work I was interested in when I started writing a while ago. Maybe alternating every other day or just working
as the mood strikes me. I really want to build general knowledge of computer 3D graphics and not just have a trivial
knowledge of Godot (or any other prebuilt environment). I don't know if I'll ever get anywhere doing this stuff but
I'm going to keep at it. I've thought for a long time that I'd never make much of myself so there's nothing to lose.
Even at my age, [a boy has a right to dream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTe49f5b1I) don't you think?

I don't know if I'll write again in a week. Two weeks might be a more practical time step. I promise I'm not done yet.

To be continued.

<h1 class="center-text">About Me</h1>
<article>
<p class="center-text"><em>I'm nothing like the grinning future-creature you envisaged this weekend.</em></p>

My name is Alex, and I'm a computer programmer living in Southern California. I'm interested in 3D graphics, animation,
and game programming. Besides programming, I enjoy reading sci-fi and fantasy novels, playing computer games,
swimming, and, occasionally, baking. I also love to relax with a good cup of tea.

This web site has been different things at different times. Today, I'm using it to share my thoughts about the
[projects](/projects) I work on. I try to write a little report about each project I finish. Besides that, sometimes I
provide [code snippets](/code) (usually written in <span class="nowrap">C++</span>) that I find interesting or useful.

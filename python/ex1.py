# cowsay.py
#
# The goal of this program is to ask the user for a message, and then display that in a speech bubble attached to the cow.
#
# Your program should have the following features:
#
# 1. It should ask the user to type in at least one message.
# 2. It should display the user's message in a speech bubble.
# 3. After displaying the user's message it should display the cow graphic.
# 4. Once you have this working customize it! Can you add your own graphic? Can you ask more than one question? Can you change the speech bubble into a thought bubble?
#
# Example Input and Output:
#
#
# What should I say? Hello!
#   ------
# *        *
# | Hello! |
# *        *
#   ------
#
#         \   ^__^
#          \  (oo)\_______
#             (__)\       )\/\
#                 ||----w |
#                 ||     ||

#What should I say? Python is powerful... and fast;plays well with others;runs everywhere;is friendly & easy to learn;is Open.

# Hints:
#
# - Start by writing print(cow) and then put the rest of your program above that.
# - Remember that you can add two pieces of text together with + and repeat a piece of text with *
#

# This string that begins and ends with """ is a special string in Python. These triple quoted strings can take up multiple lines and are stored exactly as they appear in the program.
# So, this cow will look exactly right if we just print(cow)
cow = """
    \\   ^__^
     \\  (oo)\\_______
        (__)\\       )\\/\\
            ||----w |
            ||     ||

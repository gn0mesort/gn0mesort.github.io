          <h1 class="align-center">About Me</h1>
          <p class="indent">I like programming, video games, and drinking tea. Graphics programming (2D currently and hopefully more 3D focused in the future) especially interests me. I've been fascinated by video games since I was very young. My favorite games are mostly Japanese Role-playing games like Final Fantasy. I started with Final Fantasy VII in 1996 and have been hooked ever since. I also really enjoy Roguelike games. Currently, my favorite programming languages are C and C++. I think there is great value in simplicity and hope this web page reflects that.</p>
          <p class="indent">In the future, I might put some writing here. For the time being, it will probably be fairly sparse.</p>

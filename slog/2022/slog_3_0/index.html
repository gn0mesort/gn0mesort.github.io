  <article><h2 id="personal-stuff">Personal Stuff</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a bit depressed lately so I&rsquo;ve forgone writing anything. I keep trying to write but I haven&rsquo;t been happy
enough with the results to post anything. My plan, is to keep this short and largely personal rather than talk about
any big ideas I have. It&rsquo;s tempting to go in that direction but I don&rsquo;t feel comfortable speaking too authoritatively.</p>
<p>Over the last little while, I&rsquo;ve been working on a few things. Primarily, I&rsquo;ve been catching up on various household
chores. I&rsquo;ve also taken on another game development project. It&rsquo;s proceeding alright although I&rsquo;m still worried that
it will implode like last time. I&rsquo;m still working with Godot but C# this time rather than GDScript. I might share some
thoughts about Godot later on but not much has changed with me in that department. I still find it frustrating to work
with. I know it&rsquo;s a lot to ask but I wish I knew anyone with enough faith in me to let me go my own way. It&rsquo;s hard to
expect that right now though.</p>
<h2 id="foundation">Foundation</h2>
<p>I also read Isaac Asimov&rsquo;s <em>Foundation</em>. I&rsquo;ve read about half of the follow-up <em>Foundation and Empire</em> too and of
course when I complete that I plan to read <em>Second Foundation</em>. I became interested in reading <em>Foundation</em> after I saw
<a href="https://www.michaelwhelan.com/">Michael Whelan&rsquo;s</a>
<a href="https://www.michaelwhelan.com/galleries/arkady/">illustration of Arkady Darell</a>. For whatever reason, I developed a
brief obsession with this image and decided I needed to do my due diligence. I didn&rsquo;t really know much about
<em>Foundation</em> going in. I suppose, that it&rsquo;s too old for someone my age to have heard much about it. I read online that
it paralleled the collapse of the Roman Empire but that was really all I knew before reading it.</p>
<p><em>Foundation</em> does, of course, parallel the fall of the Roman Empire. It&rsquo;s pretty explicit. To me, the idea of a
historical national collapse is less interesting than the resulting loss of scientific knowledge (and corresponding
technology). There&rsquo;s not much that I can say about this that Asimov doesn&rsquo;t convey better but I worry that it could
apply as much to individuals (or groups) as to Asimov&rsquo;s Galactic Empire. To keep things grounded, I kind of worry that
I could fall into a similar trap. I feel like a lot of what I&rsquo;m learning by working with Godot is trivia.
Occasionally, I need to look up a minor linear algebra question but for the most part what I learn about is specific to
Godot. Most problems can be solved (however suboptimally) by judiciously using Godot&rsquo;s vast library of premade parts.
I worry that even if I got really good at arranging software in Godot I would essentially be stagnating. I don&rsquo;t want
to just be an arranger of premade parts.</p>
<h2 id="next-time">Next Time</h2>
<p>Since I&rsquo;m worried about stagnating, I think I&rsquo;m going to try and balance the game development stuff with the Vulkan
and X11 work I was interested in when I started writing a while ago. Maybe alternating every other day or just working
as the mood strikes me. I really want to build general knowledge of computer 3D graphics and not just have a trivial
knowledge of Godot (or any other prebuilt environment). I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ll ever get anywhere doing this stuff but
I&rsquo;m going to keep at it. I&rsquo;ve thought for a long time that I&rsquo;d never make much of myself so there&rsquo;s nothing to lose.
Even at my age, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpTe49f5b1I">a boy has a right to dream</a> don&rsquo;t you think?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ll write again in a week. Two weeks might be a more practical time step. I promise I&rsquo;m not done yet.</p>
<p>To be continued.</p>

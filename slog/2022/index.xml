      <description>Week in Review In my last post, I said I intended to spend the week working on various Vulkan and X11 things. That hasn&amp;rsquo;t happened because I was working on another project. Alongside my personal interests, I&amp;rsquo;ve also been for game projects to work on. Mostly, these projects haven&amp;rsquo;t panned out. The usual conversation I have is something like, &amp;ldquo;what kind of game are you interested in working on?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Oh! It&amp;rsquo;s really cool!</description>

      <description>About the Slog I haven&amp;rsquo;t published any of my thoughts online in quite a while. I think it&amp;rsquo;s been about a year but, honestly, I&amp;rsquo;ve lost track. When I was younger I didn&amp;rsquo;t have much of a filter about publishing. I would just write whatever I liked and it would go up on MySpace (later I would have used Facebook). I certainly didn&amp;rsquo;t worry about grammar, sourcing my claims, or presenting any coherent arguments.</description>

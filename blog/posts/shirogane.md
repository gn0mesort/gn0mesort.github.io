This is my first real shot at using this blog software so here goes nothing! üòù

A while back, maybe 2 or 3 months after I'd really started playing Final Fantasy XIV, I was approached by a couple other plays to help them start a free company. Free Companies (basically guilds/groups of players for the unfamiliar) in Final Fantasy XIV require the signatures of three players along with 15,000 `Gp` to register. So, having no real friends or attachments in the game, I joined up. I don't recall the exact name of the company when I joined it. Ultimately we had some adventures, stood on top of some buildings, chased some new players around while wearing sparkly swimsuits, and managed to buy a small house. Unfortunately after a while my company members decided that they'd like to move on to a more popular server (Sargatanas I think). I like small servers though so I stuck around and inherited the company. I got the house along with about 15 players who hadn't been online since the beginning of the universe.

Now, I'm a very solitary guy so, I decided to remove the inactive players and basically left the company empty. Later on though, I decided to get things started up again and joined forces with some friends from a Linkshell (basically an in game chatroom) I'm in. We're still a very small company but we're still in the top 300 or so companies on the server! üåü Naturally, because we're a more active group now I've been looking to upgrade from the old house to something a little cooler.

The best opportunity I've had to upgrade came in June when the newest expansion (Final Fantasy XIV: Stormblood) was released. The expansion, which I really enjoyed, adds a whole bunch of new areas to the game. Among the new areas is Shirogane the new housing area. When Stormblood launched in June, Shirogane was closed off except for viewing. This meant that while you could go there and hang out no one could buy anything. It was kind of an eerie place without any buildings (except for the NPC owned market) but it's pretty cool. Shirogane is part of the new Japanese (or maybe more accurately Asia) themed parts of the expansion. It connects to Kugane (one of the new major cities) and has beachfront property.

This morning (at like 3 AM my time) Shirogane opened up for sale! So I had naturally had to have a house. Despite a little difficulty logging in I managed to get a plot of land in the first ward of Shirogane (Plot 33)! All in all it cost about 4,000,000 `Gp` to buy the land and move our house there but I'm pretty excited about it nonetheless! Here are some photos of the new location. Apologies in advance for leaving my FPS counter in the screenshots. I should probably get a better graphics card. üòÖ

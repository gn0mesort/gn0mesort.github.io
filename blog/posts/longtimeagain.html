<p>It’s been too long again. As usual I’ve gotten into a habit of sulking rather than writing (or doing much of use at all). I’ve really tried to stay commited to improving myself but I’m not sure I’m doing a good job. Between school and my own self-pity it has been very difficult to have the energy to write anything. I’ll try to be more positive.</p>
<p>I have been trying to learn at least a bit about 2d game programming (starting this past summer especially). I’ve had to move away from SFML (which I started with this summer). SFML is a very comfortable library but since I’ve switched to using Linux as my primary operating system I’ve been using SDL2 instead. SFML just wasn’t playing well with X11. It seems to be mostly related to my multimonitor setup. My monitors both have a resolution of 1920x1080 resulting in a space of 3840x1080 pixels across the two. SFML would let me either grab one monitor in fullscreen mode by setting the video mode as 1920x1080 (this would kill the other monitor’s output entirely) or grab the primary monitor with a resolution of 3840x1080 even though it’s half that wide. This lead to a lot of graphical distortion so I decided to try out SDL2 instead. I certainly prefer the object oriented approach but hey fullscreen works 🤷</p>
<p>It hasn’t been too hard to create decent C++ wrappers for SDL2’s structures but it’s a little trickier than I would personally like to deal with. Maybe in a few weeks I’ll have a little something working though. Don’t hold me to it please 😝 I’ll do my best though.</p>
<p>I’m really trying to be better about output in general. It’s a big challenge for me to just work on something rather than start a project that I won’t be able to finish and get lost in the details. It’s very important to me that each and every component be perfectly designed so I tend to build nothing. If you don’t write anything it can’t be wrong after all. I need to start smaller and build on top of what I can do successfully but it’s a very slow procedure. Getting eyes bigger than my stomach is a constant temptation. I think I lack discipline and maybe courage too.</p>
<p>Besides the programming stuff I’ve been trying to get back into Final Fantasy XIV. It works great (60 fps on high settings) on Kubuntu with only a few minor tweaks to the standard Proton setup. I miss FFXIV a lot when I don’t play. It reminds me of things from a year ago. The whole experience of getting back into it is hard though. I always feel so deficient. It’s like I’m being judged for my gameplay decisions even though the only person to judge me on that is me. It should be enough, obviously, that I just enjoy the game at my own pace. I always feel behind though. I’m also much too shy to have any free company members. Although last time I had some it ended badly 😂</p>
<p>I get in these kinds of moods where I’m really able to focus on something 100% (especially games or schoolwork). Like I was able to power through Final Fantasy VII this summer in about 5 days or I can do school projects in a couple of weeks without fail. Things that I want to do most days though just fall apart. I just don’t have that kind of motivation except when I’m really hurting. Not being able to effectively motivate myself to produce some kind of art makes me feel childish.</p>
<p>Anyway it hasn’t been an easy few months for me. Perhaps the worst part of that is how easy my life really is. Sometimes I think that I would be better off if there was more suffering in my life. Isn’t that kind of a horrible thing to wish for? Like there are people out there who are starving or dying of disease and I sit around comfortably saying, “I sure wish things were harder for me.” Oh well.</p>
<p>I think this whole post is probably an embarrassment. However, I think it’s important I write even to no one. I hope I see you again sooner than later. I’m always thinking of you. Every single day and wherever you are 🙇</p></div>

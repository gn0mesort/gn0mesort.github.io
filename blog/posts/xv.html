<p>It's been a while (as usual) so I'm writing again. Rather than update you on my personal life I'm opting to talk about video games. Since I last wrote I managed to finish up my dreadful Systems Analysis course. I've had some time to separate myself from the unpleasantness of it. Overall I think there were some lessons to be learned from it. My dad has a saying, &quot;Proper Planning Prevents Piss Poor Performance.&quot; That about sums up the lesson of Fundamentals of Systems Analysis. It was also worthwhile to learn about database normalization but I was left feeling as if the explanations in our textbook were lacking.</p>
<p>Anyway, what I really want to talk about is Final Fantasy XV. I got it (special edition because I'm a sucker) when it launched and I'm finally replaying it. What a mess. That's really all I can say. Final Fantasy XV is perhaps the apex (at least for now) of Square Enix's absolute inability to deliver a consistent product. I think we may be at a point now where the last numbered Final Fantasy title that wasn't some kind of massive project management screw up was Final Fantasy XI (released in 2002). Final Fantasy XII was a notoriously long project. It took from 2001 to 2006 and it ultimately required the removal of the game's original director (Yasumi Matsuno) to complete it. For the record, I really like Final Fantasy XII. It's a cool game and despite the ridiculous masturbation jokes that came up around the game's release (&quot;It play's itself!&quot;) I think it was a step in the right direction. After XII Square announced a whole bunch of games under the banner of Final Fantasy XIII. There are three titles that came about because of Final Fantasy XIII. These titles are Final Fantasy XIII (obviously), Final Fantasy Type-Zero (originally Final Fantasy Agito XIII), and Final Fantasy XV (originally Final Fantasy Versus XIII). Final Fantasy XIII and Final Fantasy Versus XIII were both announced in 2006. Final Fantasy Agito XIII was announced later in 2008. XIII released in 2009 and is a fairly notorious disaster. Frankly, I think a lot of the criticism of the game is reactionary bunk (&quot;Where are all the towns!?&quot;) but that it's still a poorly executed game. Final Fantasy XIII is very pretty but it doesn't communicate its mechanics effectively enough and it ultimately reveals itself to be shallow at the end. Perhaps what I dislike the most about XIII is the datalog, a menu item where the developers saw fit to dump most of the plot details in text form. Somewhere along the line, &quot;show don't tell,&quot; was forgotten. Final Fantasy XIII was not content to end there either. Ultimately about two thirds of the game was left out to get it to launch in 2009 (at least allegedly). This absent two thirds became Final Fantasy XIII-2 (which is a major improvement over the original in terms of gameplay but still gets lost in a plot that makes little sense) and Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII (which arguably achieves the mechanical goals of the original Final Fantasy XIII and is the only game even close to Majora's Mask in style that I've ever played). Essentially it took from the announcement in 2006 till the release of Lightning Returns in 2013 to complete what was supposed to be Final Fantasy XIII. Agito XIII, now Type-Zero, released in 2011. I haven't played it all the way through but it does seem more competently put together than XIII. Final Fantasy XV wouldn't make it to release until 2016 (despite its 2006 announcement). Final Fantasy XIV (1.0) also released in this time period. XIV was announced in 2005 and it was released in 2010. XIV was another notorious disaster. The game was so poorly received at launch that Square ultimately opted to <strong><em>REMAKE</em></strong> the whole game and re-release it in 2013 as Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn (2.0). Of the numbered Final Fantasy games released since XI it has taken about 5 years (on average) for a Final Fantasy game to be completed.</p>
<p>Realistically, I don't think it's a good sign that so many games are taking almost a half decade to complete. I also don't think it's a good sign that staff is frequently rearranged to complete these projects. It's maybe a little worse than it initially appears too. Between XI and XV Final Fantasy has undergone at least three engine changes. I find this a little baffling. XI and XII apparently run on the same engine (some interface features point to this such as being able to target with a cursor). XIII, XIII-2, Lightning Returns, and the original release of XIV run on Crystal Tools (originally the White Engine). XV and the post-2.0 version of XIV run on yet another engine named Luminous. That means between 2002 and 2016 Square has spent time (and money) developing three new game engines. This may very well be necessary (I'm certainly not an expert) but it can't possibly be a sign of stability.</p>
<p>The reason I wanted to cover all of this isn't specifically to criticize Square (although obviously, I think they're doing things wrong) but to provide context for why I think the things I dislike about Final Fantasy XV are the way they are. Final Fantasy XV is fun to play. I like to explore the world, I like to do both the simple hunt-a-monster sidequests and the more complex sidequests, I really like the road trip feel of the game, and in general, I like the dungeons. What I don't like is more complicated. I have some serious issues with the way the plot is presented (the plot itself is a standard hero's journey deal and not really worth criticizing). Events frequently feel like they're happening out of order, some portions of the story seem to rely on external knowledge of the plot (whether its playing the supplemental Episode DLCs or watching the accompanying CGI film that came with the special edition), enemies seem to know you personally but come out of nowhere, and (to top it off) the datalog persists as a dumping ground for story important information. It would probably take me days to cover all of my specific gripes with the story. I'm left wondering though, why have all this plot gumming up the works? Does anybody still remember Final Fantasy, the original one? Most of the game's plot is delivered in an opening text crawl at the very beginning of the game. I think video games as a whole have gotten fat. We're spoiled with voice acting, fancy 3D graphics, high definition displays, and 24+ bit color. It's not that I don't like these things (although God did say 16 colors, 640x480) but that I think they often take precedence over good execution. I wonder how much better Final Fantasy XV would be if the game just said, &quot;The evil Niflheim Empire has destroyed the Crown City of Insomnia and killed your father, the king. Now Prince Noctis is left with no choice but to seek the power of his ancestors and retake his home.&quot; Like that's really all I need. I'm not even sure if I need a major villain. Final Fantasy originally just had Chaos as the bad guy. Chaos is basically just evil but made into a physical monster for you to hit with swords. His motives aren't really important and by the time you reach him there's no real meaning to his evil plot anymore (since he's going to die immediately after you encounter him anyway). I think that I might enjoy experiencing my own story, as a sequence of disconnected adventures, more than the path laid out by the game. At the very least I don't think I would be confused by my goals.</p>
<p>To compound my problems with the storytelling in XV, I don't really feel like the &quot;evil&quot; Niflheim Empire is really very evil. It's not until almost the end of the game that you really see them do anything truly cruel. Prior to that they kill your dad off-screen (but I didn't care because he's not established as a meaningful character at all prior to that), send their goons to bug you (but they're wimps if you level enough), and steal your car. If they're so evil I want to see them pillage some towns. Maybe impose some frightening military order on the territory they control. Putting up some kinda ugly flags and killing one NPC off-screen doesn't cut it. All-in-all Niflheim seems to just be a vehicle for the ultimate bad guy to achieve his goals (even when those goals involve directly aiding the player). They're not really a believable political force in the world. I miss villains like the Kingdom of Alexandria in Final Fantasy IX and Galbadia in Final Fantasy VIII who actively hostile, uncompromisingly cruel, and driven by believable motivations. I also miss principle antagonists who I truly wanted to defeat (&quot;And Sephiroth!! To the settling of everything!!&quot;). It's not that Ardyn is uninteresting but his motivations are so far removed from me and his actions are so inconsequential to the experience of XV that it's hard to find him anything more than an annoyance. Personally, I much prefer the Kefka/Sephiroth/Kuja type of villains who are a constant source of trouble for the player. I want my battles to have meaning.</p>
<p>I've been thinking about these things (Final Fantasy XV and game projects more broadly) for a few days now and I've come to a few conclusions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Games really shouldn't turn into sprawling multi-year projects.</li>
<li>Gameplay is 100% more important than plot.</li>
<li>A good story only tells the player what they absolutely need to know and then gets out of their way.</li>
<li>Villains need to be villainous.</li>
</ol>
<p>So those are my current, probably rambling, thoughts on Final Fantasy XV.</p>
<p>I'm thinking of you, wherever you are, and hoping that you're alright out there. 🙇‍</p>
<p><strong>P.S.</strong> My tea of choice for today was peppermint. I was feeling icky this morning so I was trying to avoid caffeine. Maybe if you're thinking about me out there you'll have a cup of tea or a popsicle for me 😊</p>
<p><strong>P.P.S.</strong> I really love the main theme of Final Fantasy.</p>

<p>It’s been almost a month and this time I’m actually finding the time to write again. The problem with writing more often is that very little happens. I’m now far enough into this semester to have opinions, fairly strong ones, about my classes. My Java class fine. It’s more or less what I’ve come to expect from programming classes. My gripes about programming classes are so long standing at this point that I’m unsure if I’ve covered them. They amount to this:</p>
<h4 id="programming-class-gripes">Programming Class Gripes</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>I think most students would benefit from a project based rather than an exercise based approach (at the very least I would).</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>a la carte</em> nature of courses that exist at my school leads to a lot of review.</p></li>
<li><p>I dislike the time commitment (I can program at home just fine).</p></li>
<li><p>My school offers a lot of courses that are really just retreads of <strong>Intro to C++</strong>. This list includes <strong>JavaScript Programming</strong> and <strong>Microprocessor Assembly Languages</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>I think certain subjects are avoided to making teaching easier.</p></li>
<li><p>Some, but not all, of the instructors are lazy or incompetent to the point of being unacceptable.</p></li>
<li><p>Some people have bad opinions and (because I am on the Internet so often) I have a very hard time keeping my mouth shut.</p></li>
<li><p>I only like languages whose names start with C.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve definitely written about some of these in the past. Expect to see them again. All in all though my Java class will probably be just fine. The instructor is a nice guy and while he tends to get lost on tangents he isn’t a bad teacher.</p>
<p>The other class that I’m taking is Fundamentals of Systems Analysis. I <strong><em>REALLY</em></strong> don’t like this class (which is thankfully an 8 week online affair). I’ve been trying to put my finger on what I hate about it. I think part of it is that my sort of anti-corporate attitude. In all fairness I spent my formative years in San Francisco (2000ish to 2010). It’s not that I hate corporations or business in general (I think that running your own business is a pretty good goal in all honesty). It’s more that I really dislike business people. It’s the way they talk. I can’t stand it. There’s a sort of placating meaningless way of prattling that I don’t like. It’s doing things like saying <code>challenges</code> instead of <code>problems</code>. What I see as corporate speak is almost as annoying as Startup Guy talk. Startup Guy talk is worse though.</p>
<p>Regardless of my personal feelings, the class is basically a business class about how to manage projects. It’s not so much that it’s irrelevant to me (I think organizing and managing projects is actually one of the harder parts of writing software). It’s that I don’t plan to be giving a whole lot of presentations if I can avoid it. I’d love to learn more about software design but so far Systems Analysis is mostly about how to fill out reports and talk to managers. I suppose that’s what life is mostly about but even at my age I can’t stand it. Maybe it’s a hold over from being 13 once.</p>
<p>My feelings on Systems Analysis and corporations are best summed up with this passage from <strong>Cryptonomicon</strong> (which while not as fun as <strong>Snow Crash</strong> is still a fun book):</p>
<pre class="txt"><code>It is trite to observe that hackers don&#39;t like fancy clothes. Avi has
learned that good clothes can actually be comfortable the slacks that go
with a business suit, for example, are really much more comfortable than
blue jeans. And he has spent enough time with hackers to obtain the insight
that is it not wearing suits that they object to, so much as getting them
on. Which includes not only the donning process per se but also picking them
out, maintaining them, and worrying whether they are still in style this
last being especially difficult for men who wear suits once every five years.</code></pre>
<p>This passage (which is from <strong>Snow Crash</strong>) also applies:</p>
<pre class="txt"><code>When Hiro learned how to do this, way back fifteen years ago, a hacker could sit
down and write an entire piece of software by himself. Now, that&#39;s no longer possible.
Software comes out of factories, and hackers are, to a greater or lesser extent, assembly-line workers.
Worse yet, they may become managers who never get to write any code themselves.</code></pre>
<p>Besides my gripes about school the only really exciting thing to happen is that it rained (finally!!). We got like a whole 3 days of rain. That’s a lot for the desert I guess. I’d like it to rain more, but also it’s a <strong><em>desert</em></strong>. Hopefully the grass turns green for a couple of days (maybe even a whole week) so that I can take some pictures of what it looks like here. A little more rain has been forecasted, so fingers crossed it will get greener.</p>
<p>As always I’m thinking of you wherever you are. 🙇‍ I hope things are alright out there.</p></div>

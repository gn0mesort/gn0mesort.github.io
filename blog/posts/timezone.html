<p>For those that don't know, Hydaelyn is the fictional planet on which Final Fantasy XIV takes place. It's a peculiar place full of all kinds of fantastic things but, there is one thing I can't help but be constantly thrown off by. Hydaelyn only has one time zone and in fact only one time of day for the whole planet. This could be shrugged off during the 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 days of Final Fantasy XIV when players could only visit the main continent of Eorzea. 4.0 (Stormblood) adds a lot of new content though. Most of that new content is set in Othard. Othard, the equivalent of Asia in Hydaelyn, is clearly on the other side of the planet from Eorzea. The two most extreme visitable points being Limsa Lominsa in the east and Kugane in the west. It seems clear that, as long as Hydaelyn is a round planet, the sun should be in a different position at these extremes. This is after all how things work on Earth.</p>
Now, you might say, &quot;Hydaelyn is not a round planet then,&quot; as if this was a good enough explanation. Unfortunately, just like on Earth, there is photographic evidence that Hydaelyn is round. &quot;

</p>
<p>Considering that this image comes from a scene shown in-game I feel safe saying that Hydaelyn is in fact round. I have further tested this on my own during gameplay and recorded myself in Shirogane (a district of Kugane) and in Limsa Lominsa after teleporting.</p>

</p>
<p>Even though these images are taken, according to the game's clock, about 15 minutes apart and on different sides of a round planet, the sun is clearly in roughly the same position.</p>
<p>So what does this leave us with? I'd love to see an explanation of the funky times on Hydaelyn beyond some kind of handwavy, &quot;A wizard did it.&quot; I guess it is possible that the whole world as has been presented to us is much smaller than originally thought. This is in line with my understanding of other games like World of Warcraft. I suspect that the total game area available to players (excluding instanced dungeons) is not really accurate to the size of the continents those areas represent. It would probably be troublesome for players if they were. Perhaps there is something about Hydaelyn's solar system that is different from ours? Maybe, and this it seems to me is the best explanation, teleportation doesn't just involve space but also time travel? Although that doesn't account for travel by airship/ferry.</p>
<p>If you have any better explanations feel free to get in touch. I'd really love to know.</p></div>

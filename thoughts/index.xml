      <description>I’ve decided to begin working on a 3D library and applications. This project is something I’ve toyed with privately over the last couple of years. It’s been a lot of fun to learn about the various things OpenGL (4.x) and Vulkan can do in that time. However, I find it difficult to work consistently without any public scrutiny (potential or actual). Working in private is also extraordinarily isolating, and I hope that by regularly publishing my thoughts, I can become a little less isolated.</description>
